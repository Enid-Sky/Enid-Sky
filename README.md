### Backstory:

 <p>I'm a knowledgeable and confident technical support engineer with a passion for Software Development! Previously, I was the Tech Manager at a digital marketing company specializing in travel technology. In that role, I onboarded clients and worked with developers on travel apps, cruise/hotel booking engines, marketing tools and site enhancements.   </p>
                <p>After 9 years in travel technology, I embarked on an epic journey to up my full-stack dev skills. I'm proficient in UX/UI principles, core computer science concepts, pair programming, and created several web applications. As a recent bootcamp grad, I've demonstrated I'm a quick learner, and work great under pressure and deadlines. I'm excited for new opportunities, and I'm currently on the hunt for a technical position where I can serve as a bridge between client needs and technical solutions.</p>
