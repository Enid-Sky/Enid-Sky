### About Me:

 <p>  I’m a process driven, detail-oriented, self-starter with a passion for Software Development!  As a strategic implementations engineer, I’m enthusisatic about creating memorable onboarding experiences for clients. I also enjoy learning about new technologies, establishing new processes, researching and writing documentation.

### Backstory:
<p>After 9 years in travel technology, I embarked on an epic journey to up my full-stack dev skills. I attended Hackbright Academy, a software engineering bootcamp for women in San Francico. I am proficient in UX/UI principles, core computer science concepts, and I have created several web application projects. As a bootcamp grad, I've demonstrated I'm a quick learner, and I work great under pressure and deadlines. 

<p></p>

I'm excited for new opportunities, and I'm currently on the hunt for a technical position where I can serve as a bridge between client needs and technical solutions.</p>
