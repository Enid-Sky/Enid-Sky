### Backstory:

I have almost a decade of professional experience in tech, and I've been coding for almost two years.  Previously, I was the Tech Manager at a digital marketing company specializing in travel tech. In that role, I onboarded clients and worked with developers on travel apps, cruise/hotel booking engines, tools and enhancements... Then one day, I realized how much I love coding and got to work on an exciting new path! Now everyday is filled with magic! As a recent bootcamp grad, I'm currently on the hunt for a technical position where I can serve as a bridge between client needs and technical solutions.
